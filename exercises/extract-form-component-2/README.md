# Extract Form Component

# Challenge Description

Now that we know how to extract a component, let's go a little bit further and extract the form to its own component. 
We will do similar to the last coding challenge, extracting the template and the logic for creating and editing a movie.

- Create a `MovieForm.vue` component.
- Move the template for a movie form into the `MovieForm.vue` component.
- Move the logic for validation into the `MovieForm.vue` component.
- Listen to custom events for that component.

## Requirements

- Move the current template for the form into the `MovieForm.vue` component.
- Replace the current part of our template where the form is displayed, with the `MovieForm.vue` component
- The `MovieForm.vue` component should have the following props:
  - `modelValue`: It should receive the movie object, it should be optional.
- Create `2` custom events in the `MovieForm.vue` component.
  - `update:modelValue`: Should be dispatched when the user clicks the `save` button and include the `form` as the payload
  - `cancel`: Should be dispatched when the user clicks the `cancel` button and requires no payload.
- The rest of our application functionality should still work as expected.


## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of finished App
This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
